looking into creating and revising react specifically >> next JS + redux and later into TS and mobx / nextJS >> gatsby with wp and graphql mobx.

starting with hooks and js- no TS:
0. npx create-react-app client 
cd client > npm start / yarn start

0. manually add pages, cherck routing etc. (importing tut FE masters):
built folders: src/components + layout + pages // delete app demo files.
built layout. js + header + footer
